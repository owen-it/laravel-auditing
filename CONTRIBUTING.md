# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, but to keep things organized, keep in mind the following rules.

# Bug Reports

When reporting a bug in the Laravel Auditing package, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/owen-it/laravel-auditing/issues) of the main repository.

And make sure you follow the [rules](http://www.laravel-auditing.com/docs/master/problems). Failure to do so, will most likely result in a closed ticket.

# Pull Requests

Fixing a bug, correcting a typo or adding a new feature?

Just remember that all pull requests should be done against the `master` branch.
